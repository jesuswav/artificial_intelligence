# ðŸ“˜ Supervised Learning Examples
This repository contains hands-on examples of Supervised Machine Learning, covering both regression and classification tasks. The goal is to provide well-structured, beginner-friendly, and practical notebooks/scripts that demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate different models.

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Find

- Regression Models
  - Linear Regression
	- Polynomial Regression
	- Decision Trees for Regression
	- Random Forest Regression
- Classification Models
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Trees for Classification
	- Random Forest Classifier
	- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Evaluation Metrics
  - Regression â†’ MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ²
  - Classification â†’ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations
  - Scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps
	- Feature importance plots
	- Model comparison charts

ðŸ“Š Methodology

**All examples are structured following the CRISP-DM methodology**:

1. Business Understanding â€“ define the problem.
2. Data Understanding â€“ explore the dataset.
3. Data Preparation â€“ clean and preprocess data.
4. Modeling â€“ train different supervised learning algorithms.
5. Evaluation â€“ compare models using proper metrics.
6. Deployment (Optional) â€“ simple demonstrations for predictions.
